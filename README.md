# JuliaIntervals Webpage

This github repository contains the first draft for the JuliaIntervals webpage. It is constantly under active development. This webpage is being developed as a JSoD project by me (Luca Ferranti, aka besselj in the JSoD page aka @luca on slack). 

If you have suggestions on how to improve the webpage, be it content or appearance related, feel free to open an issue or a PR or contact me on slack

## Opening the webpage on your local machine

Clone the repository, open a julia session in the root directory and run the following command

```julia
julia> using Franklin

julia> serve()
```
This will activate the environment and open the webpage in your browser.
