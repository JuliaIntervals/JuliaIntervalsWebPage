# Tutorials

The tutorials in this section will show you how to install and use our packages. They are meant for users with no previous experience who want to learn how to use the tools. The `IntervalArithmetic.jl` package is the core package and it is needed in all the others. If you are completely new to interval arithmetic, we suggest to start there. If you are interesting in seing how to apply our packages to solve real-world problems, see the [applications](/pages/howTo/index.md) section. If you are interested in the theoretical background see the [explanations](/pages/explanations/index.md) section.
