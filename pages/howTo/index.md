@def title = "Interval applications"

This section contains examples of how interval methods can be applied to solve real-world problems. The material in this section is a collection of somehow more advanced tutorials, which assume you have basic knowledge of the interval arithmetic packages. Beginner tutorials to get hands-on practice with our packages can be found [here](/pages/tutorials/)
